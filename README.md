# Sparse Matrix Multiplication and Linear Regression on Big Data Platforms

● During this project, I undertook the challenging task of developing a comprehensive solution that combined the power of distributed computing frameworks with advanced machine learning techniques. The primary objectives were to efficiently multiply two sparse matrices using the MapReduce paradigm on Hadoop and to implement gradient descent and closed-form solutions for linear regression using Spark with Scala.

● Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills for optimizing performance and efficiency in big data processing and Ability to work with large datasets, ensuring effective partitioning and distributed computation. This project not only enabled me to gain a deeper understanding of distributed systems and optimization algorithms but also allowed me to demonstrate my ability to design and implement solutions for computationally intensive problems.
